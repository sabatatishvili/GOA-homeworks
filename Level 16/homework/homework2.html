    <p><b><strong>Sir Isaac Newton</strong></b> (1642–1727) was an English mathematician, physicist,
        and astronomer who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. 
        His groundbreaking work laid the foundation for classical mechanics and significantly advanced our understanding of the natural world.
    </p> <p>Born in <b>Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England</b>, Newton made several pivotal contributions to science:
    </p> <ul> <li><b><strong>Three Laws of Motion</strong></b>: 
        These laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, forming the core principles of classical mechanics.
    </li> <li><b><strong>Law of Universal Gravitation</strong></b>: This law posits that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every 
        other particle with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.
    </li> <li><b><strong>Calculus</strong></b>: Independently developed by Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, calculus provides a framework for
        understanding change and motion in mathematics.</li> <li><b><strong>Optics</strong></b>: Newton's work in optics included the study of the
            nature of light and color, leading to the development of the reflecting telescope.</li> </ul> <p>In 1687, Newton published his seminal work,
                <i><b><strong>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</strong></b></i>, commonly known as the <b><strong>Principia</strong></b>, 
                which presented his laws of motion and universal gravitation, revolutionizing the scientific understanding of the universe.</p> 
                <p>Newton's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements; he also served as the <b><strong>President of the Royal Society</strong></b>
                    and was knighted by <b>Queen Anne</b> in 1705. His contributions continue to influence various fields, including physics, mathematics, and astronomy.</p>
